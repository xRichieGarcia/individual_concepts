Here I'm trying to walkthroug this tutorial to model the classic MNIST digit data
using scikit-learn
https://www.kaggle.com/krogermd/digit-recognizer-with-scikit-learn



There are 3 datasets when using machine learning:

training set - adjusting weights and training model

validation set - insuring increase in accuracy of training set actaully causes an
                increase in accuracy of data set not seen before (validation set).
                The validation set tells you when to stop training to prevent overfitting
               
test set - actually checks accuracy of newly created model
