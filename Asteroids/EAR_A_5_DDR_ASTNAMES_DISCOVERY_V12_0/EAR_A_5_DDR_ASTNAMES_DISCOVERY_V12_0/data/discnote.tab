  9  Planets discovered by Prosper and Paul Henry.  In their cooperative      
  -  program it will probably never be known which of the Henry brothers      
  -  discovered which planet.  With strict impartiality, these discoveries    
  -  were announced as having been made alternatively by Prosper and by Paul. 
 10  Planet 154.  Initial announcement gave Nov. 6.

 12  Planet 220.  Initial announcement gave May 18.                           
 13  Planet 264.  Discovery possibly as early as Dec. l7.                     
 14  Planet 268.  June 9 is date of first measurement.                        
 15  Planet 323.  Dec. 20 observation seems to be a prediscovery.             
 16  Planet 330.  This planet was alleged to have been discovered 1892 Mar.   
  -  18 by M. Wolf at Heidelberg with the provisional designation 1892 X.     
  -  Only one more position Mar. 20 was obtained, and from the resulting      
  -  circular elements this object was never observed again.  In 1982 R. M.   
  -  West, C. Madsen, and L. D. Schmadel showed that these observations refer 
  -  to galactic stars, and that 1892 X does not exist.  Later in that year   
  -  the designation 330 Adalberta was assigned to planet A910 CB, which had  
  -  earlier been incorrectly identified with 783 Nora, and now newly         
  -  numbered.

 18  Planet 457.  Discovery telegram gave only Sept. 16 observation.          
 19  Planet 468.  Already photographed on Jan. 13; it is not clear whether    
  -  this should be regarded as a prediscovery image.                         
 20  Planet 47l.  May 18 prediscovery observation by L. Carnera is in error.  
 21  Planets 525, 1171.  The original planet 525 Adelaide, discovered 1904    
  -  Mar. 14 by M. Wolf, Heidelberg, was observed only during the discovery   
  -  opposition.  In 1958 A. Patry, Nice, found that this object is identical 
  -  with planet 1171 Rusthawelia, discovered 1930 Oct. 3 by S. Arend, Uccle. 
  -  This planet retains the latter designation 1171 Rusthawelia.  The older  
  -  designation 525 Adelaide has been given to a minor planet discovered     
  -  1908 Oct. 21 by J. H. Metcalf and newly catalogued.                      
 22  Planet 535.  May 9, given by some authorities, is erroneous.

 26  Planets 699, 700.  June 3, given by some authorities, is erroneous.      
 27  Planets 715, 933.  The original planet 715 Transvaalia, discovered 1911  
  -  Apr. 22 by H. E. Wood, was recovered on 1920 Apr. 23 as 1920 GZ and      
  -  given the designation 933 Susi.  The identity was discovered in 1928     
  -  and the older designation 715 Transvaalia was retained.  In the same     
  -  year the designation 933 Susi was assigned to a newly-discovered planet.

  -  1928 Oct. 25 as 1928 UF by Y. C. Chang at Williams Bay and not observed  
  -  again for many years.  It was believed to have been recovered as 1957    
  -  UN1 on 1957 Oct. 30 by Chang at Nanking, but this identification was     
  -  found to be incorrect.  In agreement with the discoverer, the

 90  Planet 1403.  Provisional designation is associated with an independent  
  -  discovery Aug. l7 by K. Reinmuth, Heidelberg, which was announced first. 
 91  Planet 1436.  The provisional designation was applied to the Dec. 20     
  -  observation, although discovery is clearly Dec. 11.  The Dec. 11         
  -  observation was originally attributed to planet 803.

 97  Planet 1491.  Discovery is clearly Feb. 23.  By error the provisional    
  -  designation 1938 EJ rather than a D designation was assigned.            
 98  Planet 1508.  Independent discovery Oct. 30, designated 1938 UO, by G.   
  -  Kulin, Budapest.

  -  was announced first.                                                     
102  Planet 1540.  Nov. 16 observation seems to be a prediscovery.            
103  Planets discovered by the Indiana Asteroid Program, Goethe Link          
  -  Observatory, University of Indiana.  This program was conceived and      
  -  directed by F. K. Edmondson; the plates were blinked and measured        
  -  astrometrically by B. Potter and, following her retirement, by D.        
  -  Owings; and the photometry was performed under the direction of T.       
  -  Gehrels.  During the years 1947-1967, in which the plates were           
  -  exposed, a large number of people participated in various aspects of     
  -  the program.                                                             
104  Planet 1608.  Observation Aug. 25 by C. Rogati, La Plata, should be      
  -  considered a prediscovery.                                               
105  Planet 1631.  Observation 1926 Oct. 5 as 1926 TH by K.  Reinmuth,        
  -  Heidelberg, should be considered a prediscovery.                         
106  Planet 1674.  Provisional designation is associated with an independent  
  -  discovery Feb. 22 by Y. Vaisala, Turku, which was announced first.  A    
  -  third independent discovery earlier on Feb. 22 was made by G. Kulin,     
  -  Budapest.                                                                
107  These planets have all been discovered as a result of the Palomar        
  -  survey of faint minor planets and subsequently identified with planets   
  -  observed at other oppositions.  In Sept. and Oct. 1960, T. Gehrels       
  -  exposed 130 plates with the 122 cm Schmidt camera at Palomar.  In the    
  -  following years C. J. van Houten and I. van Houten-Groeneveld measured   
  -  these plates astrometrically and photometrically at Leiden.  P. Herget,  
  -  Cincinnati, computed the orbits of the planets found on the NORC         
  -  computer, Dahlgren, Virginia, USA.                                       
108  Planet 1815.  Discovery is clearly Jan. 27, although this object was     
  -  originally thought to be planet 820.  By error a provisional             
  -  designation 1932 CE1 instead of a B designation was assigned.            
109  Planet 1850.  Discovery is clearly Mar. 23.  By error a provisional      
  -  designation 1942 EN rather than an F designation was assigned.           
110  Planet 1864.  First measurement Mar. 26.                                 
111  Planets 1870-1873, 1877.  Planets discovered by C. J.  van Houten and

  -  survey of faint Trojans with the 122 cm Schmidt camera at Palomar.

118  Planet 2043.  The Nov. 12 discovery observation was originally thought   
  -  to refer to 1936 TG.  By error the provisional designation was changed   
  -  to 1936 TH instead of a V designation.
