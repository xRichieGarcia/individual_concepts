  SUPPORT ARCHIVES is the mission name used to indicate data collected        
  in broad support of mission/observation planning and data analysis.         
  It includes catalogs of properties (magnitudes, lightcurves, etc.),         
  shape models, ground-based surveys, special compilations of Earth-          
  orbiting observatory data, laboratory spectra, and any other data           
  set that was not generated by or for a specific mission, or which is        
  broadly applicable to present and future researchers and proposers.         
  As of this writing, the objects observed under this MISSION_NAME            
  include meteorites, comets, asteroids, natural satellites, and
